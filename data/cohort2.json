Why and how we transmute our experiences and expunge our memory to make a perfect work of art? The first and simplest answer seems to lie in this: when we take a life and make a movie about it we take it all back. No longer do we have to feel the pain on a film set, or sit through the agony of a blood-tearing scene. We are merely actors now, a mere tool in the hands of a director, and not of our own accord - a tool given to us by another. Even the most beautiful films, in our minds, are done by an unseen crew. To capture the spirit of cinema - and the spirit of us - is to make a work of art. With cinema we are not just filmgoers, but we are artists and creative individuals through and through. You no longer have to spend hours with a screen. You can be someone who goes to the theater for the right reasons, someone without an army of film props or props people to pull at your hair on a Saturday night. With cinema we no only celebrate ourselves, but we are also artisans and craftsmen. We are not simply actors, but we are artists in our own right. It's time to take back the power we enjoy as an industry, the power we enjoy because we have it. And while there has been no immediate answer given by the film industry as to what to do about it, one thing seems clear: It's time to find a new, new path forward. One that does not depend on making any more films because they were made the old way. No more.For the past half century, we have had one great thing to celebrate: the cinematic explosion at least in our minds and hearts, the film that gave us both an adult and a life. And what better way could a year end? Let our films finally reach their highest potential: in them we begin to see beyond our own world and into something else.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Odd grammatical errors/sentence structure issues."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"3","feedback":"Grammatically sound but i have no idea what it's talking about"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"The sentences seem to flow.\n"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Overly pretentious prose for a movie review ..."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"Grammar is off and flow doesnt seem to connect"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Sounds fake to me "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"3","feedback":"It seemed very verbiose and unlike a casual review.

Meanwhile, back in Washington, Senator John Marston (Robert Downey Jr.) has been defeated and plans to replace him with a more reliable rival. He is thwarted by Sharpe's (Peter Stormare) rival, Dr. Charles Erskine (Michael Pitt), who also has a reputation as a genius. Erskine, an electrical genius, possesses the power to control matter, but he is known for his ability to create miracles and create his own \"reality,\" which was previously kept within the fictional Dr. Isaac Newton (Jeff Daniels). The \"Tardis\" destroys many buildings and destroys Erskine's own reality, and Sharpe travels to the US to kill Erskine and capture \"Tardis\" to prevent his life from being lost. However, there he is confronted by Erskine's \"daughter\" (Amy Adams), who is a female version of Elizabeth Taylor. Sharpe is forced to help Erskine when he goes to capture Tardis with Elizabeth, but Erskine and Taylor try to destroy each other too.

As usual, the zoom is very, very sharp.  Even when I use my Canon 7D Mark II lens, it's usually a little difficult at that zoom level, as the optical design does not support macro.  However, this lens is absolutely incredible when it comes to macro, even without such macro support. This lens delivers a very realistic lens effect, you'll see with the photos in my gallery. On some subjects it'll show as a distortion, but not so much that it's unusable in my opinion. When it comes to subjects with sharpness that is greater than about 1/3 inch, it will produce that optical distortion and it won't shake of your camera, as other reviews suggested.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"7D is a camera not a lens"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"looks kind of right"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Seems reasonable"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Seems plausible"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"real"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"incomplete sentence and word at end"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"The first sentence was very convincing that it was a human.

I have played Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Divinity 2, Fallout: new vegas, Two worlds 2, and Risen, and this game is right up there with all of them! Personally: I think this game is better then Oblivion, or Skyrim. No...it hasn't got the kind of flashy, smooth graphics like Skyrim has, but I will tell you what it does have that Skyrim doesn't: Two worlds is actually fun, without being repetitive. An example: I played Skyrim for a long time; I had maxed out my levels, had all enchanted dragon bone armor, a house with an almost endless supply of alchemic agents, and all that was completely useless to beat the game! Why does everyone think Skyrim is so fun? All you do over and over again is kill crypt zombies and rusty robots pretty much. Let's go spend 2 hours in another catacomb or Dwarven ruin(sarcasm). It's so repetitive and BORING!\\n\\nThe graphics in Two worlds might not be near Skyrim's, but this game has alot more to offer in the variety of different creatures to encounter, and yes...there is dragons. Different types of dragons. There is also Ogres, Hell knights, Hell lords, Hell warriors, Stone dragons, Flesh golems, Wyverns, Zombies, ghouls, Skelitons(different types), Bandits, goblins, and many other creatures to encounter. Some of them are really hard to kill, and take awhile also, so you will actually have to think up some kind of strategy to take these badboys on, being that alot of them can kill you with one ferocious claw. Different locations sport different creatures, and definitely don't go walking into a graveyard without some health potions! The weapon's are very cool, and I often would find a powerful weapon, and be counting the levels until I could use it. Covering land is alot more hard to do than Skyrim, because there is way more things trying to kill you, way more often. You really never know what you're going to encounter next, a pack of wolves, a pack of reapers(raptor looking creatures), or a whole encampment of steel golems(seriously).\\nI thought I would play the game until I couldn't level up anymore, but that never happened. I don't know when the levels stop, but it doesn't stop at 200. The map is huge and takes quite awhile to traverse one end to the other, and before you can level up an individual skill...you have to find Someone to teach it to you which can be rather difficult in this huge world. The graphics are not that bad if you don't compare it to Skyrim. The magic is also more original than Skyrim.

Ill not go into depth other than its a caught in a time loop type deal but that's never done to the extent that it gets tedious. In a way its like Oblivion only that was going to be a Manga story while this is one called All you need is Kill. I think it might like it better than Oblivion but I really have to wait till it stops repeating in my head, An easy five star anyway and a recommended action SiFi watch,","type":"real","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"What"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"reads odd"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Oblivion is a movie that "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"3","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"i'm just so confused"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"The first sentence is a stream of consciousness sentence that I don’t believe can be generated by AI"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"The tone is pretty emotionally charged"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"ideas seem too complex for AI to generate "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"oblivion is a game, manga is not?"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"The ideas make sense and seem coherent"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"3","feedback":"seems relatively coherent"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"manga story"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"sounds like a weeaboo"}]}

All the items are stainless steel. The clippers are small, but have no nail file inside, which I prefer. The scissors are sharp and easy to hold. My favorite are the tweezers. They are very easy to hold and maneuver. All three come with a comfort grip gel coating on parts of the items. Mine set is in white and for me, that's just not practical as far as keeping them looking white for long. This set would make a nice gift too.

The two lenses that are included provide the ability to take desirable photos near and far. It would be useful for anyone ordering this camera to remember lens filters, in order to protect the lenses from debris and damage. You will need a few memory cards and extra batteries are always useful. The wifi feature means easy uploading to your smartphone for social media posting or sending via e-mail. I have used the Canon Rebel series in the past and have had good luck with the model.","type":"real","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"Able to simplify language to make it easier for other customers to understand.
