{"_id":"5e8e62081c9d440000804b85","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015EY5RE","review":"I've had this headset for about 4 months now and use it mainly with Skype to call other Skype members and to call phone numbers with Skypeou, but I also use it for video calls and text messages (see my full review on the Oculus Rift here), just because I don't want to be unable to use it for this (which is an absolute necessity). The headset does support the Gear VR interface and is more comfortable, but at this stage without any VR software (that I'm aware of) I can't say that I prefer VR over headset unless I'm doing a game that uses VR at a very high level. I still have room on my list for more, though these VR-based Skype headsets fit that bill well. I like the ability to use Skype while walking through areas where the headset will be needed to use the headset's features, you can walk around and interact with people, walk through buildings, and I'm just enjoying this experience so much that I even took my family to the movie theater. This is something I'm hoping to experience for some future games where using a third party headset would be necessary to play them, but for now I've found that taking this headset with me when traveling to and from events works out well with friends. Also, as a note for VR game developers: Do NOT include a 3rd party VR headset here, or try to include one unless you're willing to make a decision that could be considered problematic. Also, in the last few days people have come out in support of it asking me if I feel comfortable enough for headset use. I just have to stay humble and go with my gut feeling.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"doesnâ€™t use idioms correctly"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"not sure - the run on sentences are sus, but its mixed with short ones "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Seems more like a book summary than a review"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"It made sense and was written well."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Links to other reviews"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"Weird typos (\"Skypeou\") and non-sequitur of Oculus RIft "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"randomly changed subjects to VR, which has nothing to do with before"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Didn't catch anything to make it seem like it was AI generated"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"There are relevant details and ones that I would associate well with gamers, say."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Sounds like a human\n"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"sounds like what a normal person would say"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"the review emphasized the company A LOT. it almost sounded like it was defending the company, while putting little to no attention to the actual product. also, i can't imagine a review sounding this formal.

{"_id":"5e8e62111c9d440000804b86","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0011UNMIK","review":"I've used the Garmin Forerunner 405 with HRM on a daily basis for well over a month, and recommend it highly.  I'm a multi-Marathon runner a bit overweight (over 300 lbs) and have been trying to cut my training fat % to keep up with my marathon training. The Forerunner 405 is my all-time favorite device for marathons, and I'm extremely happy that I switched from HRM to a Garmin device for more accuracy, features and consistency. When paired with HRM I am able to use the HRM app for everything and then just look the data up myself. Everything on the Forerunner 405 is well made, features and is very intuitive. While all other devices have a Garmin interface on them and have some kind of feature list associated with them, the Forerunner lets you just look up GPS info or track info for individual stages or races. You have a ton of customization options, and I like the default Garmin app for tracking. The app works with the Garmin Connect for Android app, but can also be updated to support Garmin Connect for iOS. If I'm using the Garmin Connect app on the phone and I'm going to the gym, I know that the data on my phone will be updated to reflect that. On my Garmin device I can also easily share a link that will tell my phone where to find my data. On the app when you click 'Run in my Activity' you get the running stage details and information on the start location of the stage, distance covered, time used, and my time for the finish line. I never use any other apps these days but I have noticed some improvements from this new Garmin app. The last thing I need is to go on any type of treadmill, have to take my phone to the gym every day, or start reading to find out where my data is. I would love to make that change, and it is an awesome experience to set my wrist and my heart rate over a period of time. Not the most intuitive interface but a very nice touch.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"no weird grammar"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"i dunno - mix of fact and opinion seem pretty legit"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"Good variety of sentence lengths and complexity"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"It made sense and there were specifics on the person's weight, etc."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"300 lbs+ multi marathon runner??"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"300 pounds is not a bit overweight"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"randomly changed subjects to VR, which has nothing to do with before"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"tone seemed human"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"While there is a personal element, it feels unoriginal and so can be very easily fake in my mind."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Sounds like a human\n"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"really specific"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"\"just look the data up myself\" seems a bit weird"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Includes really random product specs that seems like you could find on the company's website.

{"_id":"5e8e62191c9d440000804b87","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013FW8XS","review":"I've been looking for a dual-disk NAS option for a while, and after reading all the reviews, I figured I'd take my chances with a 1TB ReadyNOVA WD400G. I don't use the 500GB model, but this NAS is pretty big. The enclosure is made from a thick piece of flexible plastic and can hold up to 2TB of data, and at 7.5\" diagonal the bay space is also reasonable. This comes with a single USB 3.0 adapter that requires 3/4 the port area to expand your data storage. I'm not too fussy about connectivity, despite not being a regular networker, and I find that the two controllers for networking are pretty good. The NAS comes with an Intel 82567 controller card with Intel Gigabit Ethernet, a 3.5mm headphone jack and two mini-DisplayPort outputs on the front, a dual MiniDisplayPort and an SD card reader for accessing the external SD card. The 2TB drive is nice and small, but it only runs a limited configuration of Windows 10. If I ever want to upgrade to OS X, the drive has to be completely removed from the NAS to put the OS on it. The built-in SSD is pretty solid but doesn't perform as well as it was designed to. It still does plenty of read and write and won't get stuck when reading files in the storage pool, but it also makes it difficult to remove the drive. Another issue is that the onboard Thunderbolt 3 port doesn't have any of the built-in features the newer USB 3.0 controllers and DisplayPort to DP adapters don't have. Most of the time the drives will just work with it, but they get noisy in the background. I've had 2 different WD NASes with those drives and both came running Windows 7 with the same issue. This isn't a big deal for the most people, but if you don't have a lot of time to change the operating system, it might not work.For what it pays for what it gets it, this is really a good drive as it performs well and is quite quiet under load. The 3.5 mm HD audio jack has excellent quality and there are two 3.5 mm jacks on the front side that are easy to reach with one hand. You get two USB 3.0 ports on the card, but you need to expand your storage with a Micro SD card to use the USB 3.0 connection.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"sentences don't make sense together"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Seems legit and makes sense"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"3","feedback":"I think real?

{"_id":"5e8e62211c9d440000804b88","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00176BDD4","review":"Ignore the negative reviews.  This is a good starter camera for beginners who is just starting to get into the professional photography fiel, or who are just getting started in digital photography.  It is a simple and quick camera that does everything well for the consumer as well as a full range of images to be taken as well.  As you progress more into the professional scene you will need a bit of experience with digital imaging cameras to understand how to develop and manage the features, but the feature set is very usable enough for beginners.  This is a great camera for travel, and is very affordable.  It is highly recommended that you buy at a retailer such as ebay, eBay seller or used camera store to get a better chance of purchasing one or more items from a seller that is available for free. The camera is a good value.  While the camera is priced very conservative, the cost is more reasonable than most consumer cell phones I have seen on the market.  The camera is smaller and lighter than most consumer cell phones, and therefore allows the use of the smaller 2K resolution video recording.  As a result, the camera can easily be carried by individuals, and as my sister and I got together a couple of times, we kept using the camera more often then not. Conclusion This is an inexpensive, easy to use camera with fantastic image quality and compact body.  If I had it to buy in a few years I would definitely pick this up.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Seems legit and makes sense"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Seems real because of phrases like \"ignore the negative reviews\""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Typos, sounds authentic"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Language seems natural"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"felt natural"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"sentences seemed choppy"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"Not much personal, but I've seen reviews like this which sometimes serve to drive people to buy the product, especially at other vendors."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Seems like it's going against negative reviews "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"sounds genuine."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"it sounds like a scam post, but i don't think it was AI generated. i think somebody with poor Engilsh skills was hired to post this "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Really authentic language, no unnecessary details, and good use of personal experiences."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Looks machine generated.

{"_id":"5e8e622e1c9d440000804b89","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0007149832","review":"This is one of the 'great' American novels. The term 'great American/Irish/British' novel is bandied about frequently as commentators genera, and I have rarely found one that felt as close to home, a deeply unsparing study of social problems and a humanizing story of courage. The author, John Kennedy Toole, creates a very real sense of the times, in a city in which he felt almost at home. The central idea of this book is that people from all walks of life are coming home and their children should be at home as well. I really found it hard to put down the first few pages and it has stayed with me ever since. The writing skill is astonishing. It seems almost natural to a person living in such a difficult time of economic depression, war, and the social fabric changing in its way. I could have easily ended up feeling as though I have experienced things all over again and was just like everyone else. Toole makes this a central part of his personal narrative. You don't see how much it hurt him to live in a city that was very different from the other places he grew up in. Toole is often funny-loving in his prose, his language, and his humor. There is a real sensitivity to people from all walks of life, to those who were born poor and didn't develop to their full potential or have parents who had less than ideal lives. We learn something about the things that are lost and the things that happened so tragically. As for the overall theme, it is very human. But he manages to make certain points about why we are at this point and what we can do about it.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Doesn't feel right"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"3","feedback":"Could be real but some parts such as \"The central idea of the book...\" didn't really make much sense."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Conveys conviction"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"well written"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"stopped making sense"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"details imply that this person actually used the product"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Feels like an essay that would be written by a literature lover about their favorite book"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Human emotion is shown "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"sounds a bit incoherent"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Authentic personal account paired with descriptions of feelings that the product evoked made it seem more real."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Looks fake.

Although I found this a pithy and well paced read, I'm not sure if it is a genuine or made up story. At least for the first page, it sounds like it's a real story and it does cover a very small portion of the book. I was afraid to read that way because of the lack of detailed characters. But the stories were interesting and they gave me some hope that the characters would be believable, that they would not be an invention. I do like the plot.  The characters were well developed and acted well in that it was easy for them to become real human beings. The first time I read this I thought it was really funny, but I could not help but laugh and then to be sure the rest of the story did not drag on and they eventually felt real. As for the story itself, it made me wonder what the characters are thinking and thinking back to when they were young and how they managed to change their ways, how they got what they wanted. It may have taken me a while to feel the emotion but I liked it a lot. I would also like to suggest that if you are a fan of stories about the future, this is a must read.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Doesn't feel right"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Doesn't seem to be any structure to this review"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Seems forced"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"Felt natural"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"inconsistent? went from unsure about being made-up to characters being realistic"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"details imply that this person actually used the product"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Feels genuine, related well to what I would expect from a non-professional book review"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Human emotion is shown "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"sounds a bit incoherent"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Negative information.

The book went on forever, which is fine since I dislike short novels.  The back and forth  between Emily and Steve is like a couple that have been together for more than five minutes, all to be taken apart. I love the concept of the story. They can't put their relationship together. It is a beautiful situation. The two lovers go through life together, even though there is always a chance they might never meet each other again. They get caught up in all their troubles, even if it means they get a lot of grief. Emily's life is all about the story, and she always has a dream to dream about. It's a reminder of how hard life is and it always seems like Steve always wants to do too that, that's what brings Emily back and renews her spirit. What really makes this so much better than anything else I have read in a while is the characters. It's a combination of a happy couple, who find the perfect partner in life.  One moment is great and the next, they go on their mission from there.  And I absolutely loved the way Emily and Steve came back to their relationship one last time. You can tell by the content that Steve is doing with it that it is so important to him to make sense of his feelings. It really is. There are times where he may have gone on with his life and then find out there is more to learn.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"sentence structure"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"1","feedback":"test"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"Some of the sentences don't follow from the previous sentences"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"A couple together for more than five minutes?"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Felt disjointed"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"hard to tell, felt sorta naturally meandering. a bit incoherent, but could've been an actual person"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"details"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Detailed in the right ways, and seems written by someone who has clearly engaged with the book."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Lowkey all reviews seem human like\n"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"somewhat incoherent"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"very repetitive and verbose (a real user wouldn't care enough to write so much nonsense)."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Looks real exhibiting the feelings of the individual.

A few years later, she was moved to the States where her religious background was also respected.  After a quick meeting in her first week of classes, she was excited to see a new professor that would help her cope with life at home, she soon discovered that she was more than interested in Jesus Christ and how he brought down his Father.  After receiving a Bible and the Bible's Spirit, it took Kim some effort to get to know him, but with the help of a few supportive friends she finally felt at ease. Within a few months they were becoming more close and eventually Kim felt ready to come home.  PUST was her gateway into Christianity and eventually she fell in love with the Bible, a topic she loved and was able to study in depth over a period of years.  During the time she went to college he was working as a Bible scholar, teaching Hebrew and Greek at a seminary and now that she was returning to the U.S to begin an actual ministry, PUST was the best thing for her.  She has continued to learn about Jesus Christ and what he did for her, it has only increased her faith which was very healthy in the beginning.  Her journey also taught her that she didn't need to change her faith at all with the help of Bible study.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"too formal"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"There is a storyline in this one that makes sense from sentence to sentence."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Sentences don't make sense"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"mostly made sense. sort of inconsistent, but could've been written by a real person?"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"have no reason to believe otherwise"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"This is just a summary of contents of a book (?)... nothing *review* about this"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Describing stuff too much"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"sounds like a very specific synopsis of a book and it made sense"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"This isn't even a review, just a description."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Looks fake.

This time greed and an emerging danger combine to tell a dramatic tale of a race against time as the former park faces destruction from the volcano. The actors were perfectly cast, and their interaction carried the picture to an interesting conclusion ( perhaps setting the stage for the final film, due I believe 2021) and which promises to be just as good as its prievous films. Get the bluray and watch the final extra by Barbasol its great! but only on the bluray.

After using my skin felt tight and itchy and to calm it I had to use a total body lotion after the shower. This soap arrived in a clear plastic wrap with no labeling at all without an ingredient list. The scent to me is of citrus and I suspect the natural oils of the citrus fruits in the fragrance are what is oil-stripping my skin and leaving me with dried out skin. Ratings 2 stars = Don't Like It. I cannot comment on anything else about the ingredients since I have no ingredient list and there is not one on the product page either.","type":"real","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"2 stars = i dont like it"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"It is cohesive"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"2 stars = dont like it"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"logically coherent, sentences led into each other, had overall structure"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"weird phrasing e.g. \"the scent to me is\""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Reads quite similarly to reviews I have seen before.

I enjoyed the wording and style employed by the author; the sentences and paragraphs were both very fluid and readable.  My main complaint with this book is that I do not feel that I learned much by reading it, i.e., I do not believe the factual information to words ratio (facts/words) was high enough for me to recommend it to someone else.  In some parts of the book, it seems that the author attempts to employ a written form of filibusters.  Usually after reading a few pages or chapters of a non-fiction book, I have to sit back to take in all the information.  This book never necessitated such a pause in my reading.  In short, I believe this book may be interesting to those few people extremely interested in Hirohito's role during and after World War II.  But, I believe most people will agree that the best one-word summary of this book would be as follows:  Overrated.","type":"real","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"Interesting comments"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"Sounds very real"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"Sentences sound real"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"coherent, had a thesis, overall progression/structure made sense"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"no reason to believe otherwise"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Very personal, good critiques, and fairly academic in nature.

The image is sharp, crisp, and bright! The 3440x1440 resolution looks amazing. No dead pixels and this monitor does not have speakers but that's ok. About 95% of the time I want to hear something I use earphones so not a big deal for me. You can always attach your favorite speaker, earphone or headset to the 3.5 mm jack on the back of the monitor. When I used the OnScreen controls to split the screen to multiple smaller windows I noticed a small gap between the windows. I thought this was a defect so I emailed LG tech support on the night of December 25th & on the morning of December 26th I received a reply stating the gap was normal. I wasn't sure if I believed tech support so I called them on December 26th from work. I went through a quick menu and spoke to a live person in a few minutes. That tech guy also told me the gap was normal. I looked up a few models on YouTube & noticed some LG models also had this small gap. After thinking about it was not a big deal & I love the monitor!
