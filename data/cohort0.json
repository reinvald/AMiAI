I was worried that the author would get overly bogged down in the horrors of a human population slaughtered by disease. It was not until I read the book that I realized how much it had left me shaken. I never did come away with any sense of comfort or understanding that I am not alone, I am one of many, nor will there ever be. We're all still alive, we're just not alone anymore. And we're all affected by the same diseases we are all born with. I am, in fact, one patient in a small number of other cases, and it's the most heartbreaking case as well. I think the horror in this book will keep you for days.

This book was such a disappoint after having read Tangled. I did not enjoy Kate's POV of her daughter, and had to read the rest of the book out of the idea of her daughter loving her. Also, I was so bored with the dialogue at the end that I don't think I liked it at all. I don't wish to disparage the book, but I found most of what I was telling the writers more interesting than what happened. There were even a number of moments where I liked Kate's narration, and while my opinion of one scene were strong, I don't think I enjoyed her narration enough to rate it.

The term 'great American/Irish/British' novel is bandied about frequently as commentators genera- tionally claim that the 'great' America/British novel, in the same vein as Homer's Odyssey, or the American epic like Huckleberry Finn, should come to dominate American literature. My point has always been that the American novel in this context, which is the American tradition of literature since the 17th century, might well be at the apex of literary development, even by European standards. I have never seen an American national literature anywhere, even during the first half of the twentieth century, that didn't have its roots in a British tradition. From Thomas More's poem to Jack London's novels to the works of John Milton, American writers are, as Charles Dickens would have told Charles Dickens' friends, all descended from British 'the Great British Novelists'. If this was the case, why does it make so much sense to me that I should be in the English tradition, which is probably closer to the true American tradition than almost any other tradition? Why do so many Americans think that English nationalism should come, somehow, to dominate U.S. literature? Why do they feel the need to identify with the American tradition to the extent that they should make a national identity out of it? I have tried to answer this question.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"The sentences don't contextually fit together."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Loses focus on the book itself"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"The tenses change"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"The structure seems too well worded"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Jumbled sentences "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"The comparison to other tales and use of personal pronouns like I made me think it was an actual person."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"Not sure about this one.

I love good books about football players and love. This book was just that... and more. Where I felt like the first book, Blitzing Emily, was a bit on the long side and dragged a little, I never felt that about this book. Amy and Matt were both more relatable and I loved their courtship and everything that came after. The characters were a little older than the ones in books I tend to read, so there was more maturity and I liked that.\\n\\nAmy was likable and I connected easily with her. She was sweet and sassy, she loved football and her family and she wasn't looking to get serious with anyone. Meeting ex-NFL player and current sports broadcaster Matt threatens to derail her plans. They share an immediate spark, but she fights it. He does everything he can to subtly get to her and I adored the scenes where he was ordering flowers for every woman in his life to make her jealous. I found it cute and clever. Matt was conceited, but not a jerk. He was actually a pretty great guy. I loved his relationship with his daughter and the one that eventually built between Amy and his daughter, too. They were believable as a couple and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about them.\\n\\nI was really impressed with Rushing Amy. The characters had depth and their relationships with each other did as well. The romance was sweet and it built slowly over time, which made it more real. I connected enough with the characters that I enjoyed reading about them as individuals as much as reading about them as a couple. This book had both an ex-wife and a daughter and the author, thankfully, stayed away from the clichd storylines and character types when it came to them. Amy and Matt were both smart and had strong personalities, which led to a bit of drama, but it was understandable and not unnecessary.\\n\\nRushing Amy was romantic, sexy and more or less angst-free.

There are plenty of men who would fit in those sizes.","type":"real","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Review is descriptive"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"repetition"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"A lot of personal detail and opinion "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":""},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"This sounds like a real concern that I also face when buying sweatshirts"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"The structure seems too well worded"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Relatable "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"A strong feelings about it makes it seem real\n"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Repeated itself in a very unhumanlike way.
