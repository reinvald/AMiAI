{"_id":"5e8130891c9d4400004f6a9b","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005FMZN82","review":"I was hesitant to ask my wife to wear this watch initially given the white color. But she sportingly tried it along with a sky blue jacket t-shirt that complemented the white and black. It was an easy decision that paid off with a clean and sleek look. This is my first time wearing a Timex that was made in Japan. I was also impressed by the black and cherry dial at 7 o'clock and 5 o'clock. If you need any clarification on what 1 o'clock does, it means 10 o'clock. This is the 1 o'clock version used for the most part in the US. I've got a very detailed review coming later this month on the finer points of my Timex review. For now you'll need to pick up the one of the two options above except for the date window to select \"regular\", \"black\" and \"grey\". You can also change the case material under the dial design in the \"Tools\" page as well. But when I got home I decided to do some experimenting and got myself a nice, classic black and grey watch case in the \"Dial\" option. I also picked up a white case to use for my white watch. It's called a \"White Oak\". I didn't get into case work at all with this watch: most of the features I use are on the dial or within hours of my eyes (at least with my white watch). This watch is more a tribute to my childhood, though there's a certain charm to it, too. After picking it up it just looked right on my desk and is a fitting tribute to my father. Although I don't use any case work, I am always watching for my vintage timepieces and this one was a great addition for me. In terms of watchmaking, after spending a lot of time on it I got the best out of it, and am very happy with how this watch works. I'll be writing an in-depth look at how we managed the time with this watch later today (September 30).","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"The sentences seemed to be weirdly constructed as if they were written by a robot."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"too elaborate, detailed. people usually leave pretty polarized comments and this is decently neutral"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"the wording seems more personal"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"jawn sounded exquisite "},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"\"sportingly\""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Language is too proper.

{"_id":"5e8e5b151c9d440000804b58","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/162253316X","review":"The Dynamic Duo has done it again! Brink of Dawn is very well written with great character development, just enough drama to keep the characters interested and the main characters strong. The story is very dynamic with the two main characters being extremely conflicted/skeptical of a lot of different things throughout the book. All that being said, it definitely doesn't need much to make it enjoyable, so if it's that simple, then there is definitely a good balance to it. I loved how quickly the characters developed as a whole group and did their stuff together. Each of the characters just became a great dynamic partner and the writing was incredible for it all.It took me about three and half hours to finish this book. The main character has really gone from a jerk to a friend and I loved the writing and overall structure of the book. Unfortunately, it didn't really come together as a cohesive whole yet. There are a few moments that aren't quite right and one or the other would be pretty nice to read as a standalone book, but overall, I think the book is solid and I've given it a 4 out of 5. I think it's also worth pointing out that Brink of Dawn isn't just one of my favorite new releases of the year; it was a major favorite. This is the first of the \"dynamic duo\" books which means I also read many of the books by the same two authors, but at least half of the titles are from the new generation of authors from both the SF/F/P/W and fantasy/science fiction genres. So I'm not just one of the more active readers, but I am the one who has read some of the more successful books from this generation of authors.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"The sentences have pretty good grammar but not descriptive.

{"_id":"5e8e5b8c1c9d440000804b59","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UUUFT6","review":"My 8-year-old daughter uses this bag for dance class, and she loves it. I bought it for her almost 2 years ago, when she was 6, and it is sturdier than the one she had in her school. The strap makes it a fun and fast bag because it is adjustable to make a lot of different things easier to put in it. In general, it fits her better than most of the other styles. But like the other girl said, one reason I chose the \"bag\" instead of a skirt or skirt/skirts was because the straps aren't adjustable to adjust her height better. I love my bag! I usually put her in it with no straps, now she doesn't even need her own straps. The straps are very secure to her because she takes them off in front of her and then she sits in them to adjust them. I use the straps to close her skirt or skirt/skirts. One time she got too wide, and she had one too big opening in her skirt! So I have only used it once in the past 9 years, because I could have had to go home and get it fixed (I have since had it fixed, but it's still pretty wide). It works okay for dancing since she does so well with the \"bag\" in it. It seems a little heavy, but I only have a 9\" head (and a 13 inch waist) and I'm not 6'. This is the \"bag\" that's meant for me, since I do have a lot of friends who like the bag, so I'm not worried about it. As far as use goes, it is the only bag I have that I have kept for more than a week. In fact, I have already started wearing it again and it's awesome! She's gotten very good at holding it up in a dance class; she's even taught me to pull it out, pull it back and keep at her sides. I bought it for \"the girl in me,\" my best friend since I was 4! I'm sure her bag is fine for a girl who wants to be a lot more than 6' with her skirt or skirt/skirts, but I wanted something that could hold up for longer periods of time. Other people have been having fun with it, but I personally couldn't tell that it worked very well, so I bought it. But it's a \"must have\" because it's meant for that. I used to have lots of trouble putting this in my bag because the straps were so tight, but now I'm using it for dance class, dance class, dance class, dance class! I can wear it on my lap with a skirt, so it's fine for everyday wear if it's not a must-haves item. I'm so glad I bought this bag! I would highly recommend it, even if it still hasn't been fixed as of writing this review. It's not a bad bag by any means, but it may still not be the perfect bag for your body size and height, since its straps aren't adjustable. Still, I recommend it to any girl who would like to be smaller than 6'. And yes, you can even add a few straps if you're going for more \"full\" dancers than 5'.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"The person jumps from bags to skirts.

I loved this long button down denim top for the Fall months when all us BFFs went to the beach to take out the dogs.  And I was like wooooooaaaaah! This was the \"it is what it is\" look.  But as my son took home it was like hey, this is awesome!  And the first time he told me who I knew, I remember he had just come home from buying a beer at the local taproom and started telling him how good our top was and how many of us liked it.  And I remember thinking to myself \"there must be some reason I haven't started wearing this.\"  And I think if your son is the sort of guy who thinks he knows you best and wants to make you feel like YOU are his perfect fit for him it will be tough to convince him otherwise. So it worked for me.  But it is hard to be true to yourself when you can't control who you wear.  And to you, when you are doing your best to be yourself, you can't feel like you are wearing the wrong thing or wearing it poorly when you know you are wearing the most flattering and true product you can possibly be with. This is the \"it\" that will never, ever wear out, and I hope that it helps you to make a decision.  And let Me know if my comments are helpful!

{"_id":"5e8e5c271c9d440000804b5b","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000DZH9MY","review":"I received this lens as a Christmas present and I have been very pleased with it. I of course had to try a head-to-head with my 85mm f1.4 to be able to say definitively that it is better, but it didn't have any of the optical flaws that many others have to show but I think my experience was much more positive than many people would suspect. Since I have been using it, I have found that I find the focus issues to be less with this lens than with some other lenses that I have used. I find that the corners of the frame don't seem to need to be very precise to produce the most contrast and sharpness in wide open (even at the center of focus). When you look closer at the corner, the corners of the frame seem to move away from the center of the image, which makes the image more open. I also find that when using the zoom on the zoom lens and zooming up in the viewfinder, the corners of the frame are almost as sharp as they appear to be in the mirrorless camera. There are some lens images to show that I am using this lens with all of these elements in it but for the moment it is definitely in the upper end of the performance of some other lenses that I have used and I think you can use the lens to your advantage with this lens by taking advantage of some of the very strong optical features it has. The focus issue is also something that makes this an easier lens to use than all of the larger zoom lenses I have used. If you are using the zoom on the zoom lens then you can zoom and pan while still using the lens. When you look at other zoom lenses on this site, and you compare them to this lens, you will appreciate that the focus issue is one that is very difficult to replicate. This is one of the reasons I am taking this lens off the market and will be selling it off to get it corrected for any focus issues so be sure to read and see reviews about it and all of the other lenses on this site at ZOOM and then buy this lens if you ever have the chance.","type":"medium","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Good context and easily understood"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"comparing and contrasting with people's comments and other products"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"description is realistic"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"felt forced "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"flows well/cohesive"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"A bit too proper."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"A lens is a pretty strange christmas present, I guess.

{"_id":"5e8e5c821c9d440000804b5c","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004K1EZDS","review":"I'm not a techie, but know just enough about computers and peripherals to be dangerous.  I've had wireless routers since they first came out of nowhere and just had to get one of these for my computer.  And once I got it, I haven't been able to turn it off.  This thing has been working like a charm.  I've got an older 4 GHz quad core processor and a dual core dual core processor, not much memory.  Everything runs fine.  The mouse has an extra pair of keys for my touchpad, but a few extra clicks are annoying.  I just run a program to start it up, and don't bother doing anything with it, unless I'm getting something out of the device.  Since this thing has the Internet, the only way to connect directly to all my computers is through an Ethernet cable.  I have only connected via USB, and I can't quite figure out how to even read a CD.  So I do some research, and find \"Netgear\" at Best Buy.  I got a copy of the OS and booted it with a CD.  It was a joy, and I could get on with most of my stuff.  My first attempt at connecting via the USB port on my mac, I didn't even close the lid.  When I got there, the wireless router showed some error message; which I assumed was because I left it open (I don't tend to use Macs much anyway; I'm not a computer-guy).  Upon further research, I discovered that if you have an adapter, open up with your Mac/Desktop, and run the Windows IP address.  This one works with any Ethernet port.  The interface is a little complex because it has to talk with the router on port 80, but that's the only port you will need.  You can also send an email using your desktop, and it will send a response to the email address, or send you back a call.  This device connects directly to your desktop via the Ethernet port on the device.  It connects over any single port.  The device's only real downside was the fact that it kept coming up with connection errors, but no actual data connection was needed.  So I got a couple of extra router cables and changed them up.  The first time, it did not show up on my laptop and I had to log out to get the router to work again.   Having all my wireless equipment together could be dangerous and cause the problems mentioned.  With these cables I can only imagine that other computers and peripherals will come up with connection errors when you try to connect using it's ethernet.  I'm really glad it worked, and I had no idea that this would be my ultimate router of choice.    The second time that I connected via the wireless port was slightly more of an issue.  One of the router's computers refused to login so I turned it off.  The second time I worked something out with my computer, I had no problems, but I must have been wrong, because I still went through the trouble of resetting all my settings and checking the computer to see if it had the router properly installed and configured.  The router still refused to connect.  With those modifications, I tried it with my iPad, and the wifi worked!   This device connects through the Ethernet and I connected via my router using my desktop, then just my computer.  It's pretty much an all-in-one.  It runs a Windows box just like the iPhone does.  But now I have my router all working with the Mac and there are no wireless issues.   The best feature: the Ethernet card.  This wireless card has a built-in data port so you can plug anything in and stream, transfer movies on your tablet or laptop, send and receive email.  There's a USB port as well when you plug in the tablet that is handy for USB devices that don't support Bluetooth.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"Good context and easily understood"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"very odd references and wording"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"wording feels personal"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"sounded like a review from a customer"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"flows well/cohesive"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"\"just had\""},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"He's dangerous?? \"since they first came out of nowhere\" also sounds pretty scrambled together.

{"_id":"5e8e5cbe1c9d440000804b5d","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ISBG79Q","review":"I was looking for a compact bag to carry my Fuji X gear (X100T, X-T1, 18-55mm, 14mm, and 35mm), and this was *almost* the perfect bag, but ugh.  1) it's very heavy. I know most people do a bit of research before buying and buying something new, but for me this is a total non-starter. I love my X100T and get frustrated when it's not light enough to hold a camera, so this bag feels heavier than what it should be. We do a few hours a day of heavy shooting each weekend and sometimes carry more gear than the X100T (which I also use for video, so the extra stuff gets in the way), but, considering how heavy the X100Ts weigh, it's not such a good idea to buy anything heavier than that and carry a cheap camera, even one that's pretty heavy.  2) It's so uncomfortable. It is incredibly heavy.  I have some very sensitive skin and some very sensitive fingers, so this thing is just not comfortable. It's kind of like carrying a cheap camera on top of my laptop, and then you put a bag over it and it's just hard to get it to fit. You can't put anything in the bag if there is an extension cord, because that also doesn't fit well, and you really struggle with the way you hold the bag while you're driving: as if everything is holding this bag.  3) It's also heavy, since the top of the bag is thick and full of metal. It's heavier than my bag that has some metal inserts on the inside, and that also weighs two times as much. While I think it's an idea this would be made by Nikon, it's not. Nikon makes cheap plastic bags with metal inserts in them that are not very durable, so it's something of a waste. This bag is definitely heavy, but it's also the worst bag I've seen in a long time. This bag is a nightmare to take and holds a bunch of stuff, even with the extension cord, because the plastic pieces are so heavy.  4) It's not long enough for a small camera like this. The front pouch is huge for small cameras like this to be comfortably inserted, which means you do have to carry it everywhere, so I could easily lug it back to my studio after using it a few days to make certain everything was out of the way of the cameras.  5) The quality of my photography is not affected because of the bag, although I would do say the bag is better in certain areas than when in the pocket. It's like the corners are slightly different color, but it has the same shape and the same height (about a yard). The front zippers are very tight... they've got a plastic knob that you have to remove.  6) it's not cheap quality (as advertised). The bag is really big and bulky with the metal inserts that makes it look heavy. It also has a weird shape that it's harder to turn off than the pouch shape. The stitching on my bag has a black plastic smell, so it's very, very ugly. I'd say it's about $50 for it's quality, but I'd pay less just to use it a bit. Also note that while my X100T has a very strong front zipper that takes the hassle out of how the bag feels inside, the Fuji X100T has a much thinner zipper with a metal knob that takes the hassle out of how the bag feels. I think that's also the main reason the bags feel so much heavier-- it's a way to hide stuff in there.  7) the metal tabs on the end of the bag were really big. Not what you would try to fold your camera around in if it was anything less than a quarter inch thick.  8) the whole thing feels really heavy. The metal is thick and heavy. This thing also doesn't fit a computer that's much more versatile and you can't attach a cable.

{"_id":"5e8e5ce51c9d440000804b5e","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017BPMF9U","review":"I LOVE this bag! It is unbelievably well designed - I have no doubt that I could use it every day for 10-15 years and it would hold up becaues it can be opened/sealed. The side pockets are a must, and these are HUGE. Not for holding a laptop or phone, but are there to store items. Not much room for stuff, but space for other things. The large zippers and drawstring are great for keeping things handy. I am a big laptop user, and the zipper pulls seem a lot stronger than they used to, and the small ones can be opened/closed quicker, which makes it go faster in my opinion. I like that the zippers allow for a single pocket, rather than two if necessary, but I personally prefer two. The interior can hold a laptop, a lot of paperwork, a few pairs earrings, a few cellphones, some other small items. The zippers are a bit tight. I would have preferred them to be a little wider, and they are still a little tight on this small bag. One zipper would have been more generous if there were 2 larger zippers. But the bag is made well enough for most, especially those of us with a small head. It feels cool/well-made. It is very well packed. I am not a huge bag, but it does what it says on the tin - it is very well-stocked and looks great. I am going to buy another one for my kids once they have more room in their lives.  Also, the shoulder straps seem a little weird. I have been a big, heavy backpack fan for years, and am used to heavy duty shoulder straps being difficult to open. So I would do my best to not leave the bag open when I take it in and it is open while I am typing or hiking - it might make some people want to open the bag when they get back.  It is very easy to open without a second thought, even without being careful with the zipper. The bag also gets dirty easily, even when it is sitting in our car. Although it smells like it's been here some time, I haven't let it get soiled and dirty that I would buy a new one as a replacement, or would even buy another one to add to the mix.  Overall, I love this bag. I would highly recommend it. Its perfect for a daily carry on or to travel, and I love having it in my car to carry with me, etc. I think the most important thing is that it looks nice. It's like it would have been a lot bigger in the picture (which I don't mind too much) but it's just so cool in person. It'll keep me warm all winter to mid summer! It's so small, it can only fill the middle pocket with stuff, but when I get home I will leave one piece of clothing at home - I am a fan. It can also store a backpack for the kids, which is a real bummer. I know it's bulky, there are a few different styles of bag on the market today, but this one isn't that and this one won't be that one. I actually bought it to replace what was lost to me when I got it.  It's a very nice bag. The zipper is flexible and snaps securely (even if you keep your device in the pack, this bag doesn't have a zippered loop). The interior lining is quite stretchy for carrying your carry on and on in.  The bag does have pockets, which is great, but the zipper doesn't open like a lot of large bags do. I would prefer that this bag would open more frequently, and that two smaller zippers would be built into the bag. It would be easier to open your laptop with the top zipper and take some extra water or other water. Also, the zippers are kind of flimsy, even for a large bag.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"Good context and reasonably constructed sentences"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"4","feedback":"hard to say"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"not realistic to how humans speak"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"felt like a mom "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"focused on bag, flows well"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Sounds like an AI, trying to be human."},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"Does it fit a laptop or not?"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"10","feedback":"a lot of discontinuity in thoughts and information"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"The grammar and points made don't make complete sense but the errors seem consistent with ones humans make.

{"_id":"5e8e5d461c9d440000804b5f","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/6305006598","review":"I love Tarantino's style, which is powered as much by mood as by story line.  I have viewed this film at least a dozen times now, and it has been one of the most moving, emotionally evocative, and consistently good movies of the decade. But this movie is also a classic from an important point of view, because there is little else as compelling as the concept of human agency, and it is the central story of Tod Browning's career at the time.  The plot--or more specifically the dialogue--is, like his early films, a little off, but it is clear to see Browning's genius of using words and acting over the course of three and a half hours.  For every 'hero or idiot', however, there is probably another two that do more for society.  The story, which revolves around a man named Quentin--a man with a penchant for guns, a tendency to take out terrorists, a lust for justice, a love for beauty and a love of beauty--tends to keep you at the edge of your seat. It keeps you thinking.  From start to finish, almost every minute of this film is worth seeing if only you make a reservation so the movie can be played on your television set.  For a small screen movie, it is quite something.  It is so often a joy to watch a young actor on a grand scale (Tod's was a prime example for me, and it has remained one of my favorite films all those years that I still remember).  The film itself is an exciting adventure film.  From the first time you have the 'view and pause' feature, you feel like you have been there--watching this film for the first time.  You are at a crossroads and you must make a decision, but it is all within the movie setting by Browning.  As such, the film is a slow burner for me, and the audience is always asking questions of Browning, like, 'why did you shoot this guy so hard?' or 'why did he shoot this dog?'.  Browning has crafted an impeccable performance.  He uses his lines and gestures like a painter (he's the artist in this film), and the characters seem to move the story along with him--one of the best in modern cinema.  As an actor, I never wanted to see another'meeting of the fates', but Browning makes a great case for himself with the roles of 'Quentin' and 'Bruno' and also 'Kitty'--two young dogs with an equally remarkable relationship.  The characters and the dialogue are truly original. Browning writes superbly and evokes such emotion from his actors and audiences with every character and scene--and it seems, quite simply, that the film is all Browning.  'Quentin' has a long history of violence and tragedy--he has played characters such as the man who was murdered by a sniper,the dog that killed a couple of people,a man who had to kill the mafia, etc.  It is interesting to see him in his civilian life--for example, the time he tried to murder Teddy's father by trying to hide him in a barn...but 'Kitty' is a different story.  It is a woman who has just committed suicide--the killer killed her mother and father--but it is the child that Browning creates with a new life in her that changes who she becomes and what she looks like with each new move.  That is, he gives 'Kitty' her very first real relationship, which was a love story, and she starts to build a life in 'Quentin', but she too keeps her best friend alive by showing him more of herself and the life it gives her.  'Bruno' is a street fighter who has been injured in a car crash and is back on the streets with a fractured leg--he is a bad guy--but he is quite the character, given so much of his youth by his father, a gangster.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Solid movie review"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"comparing with other films and stories"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"feels personal"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"tarantino cult fan could only write this"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Browning?"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"2","feedback":"Sounds like an AI, trying to be human."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"At least he sticks to his argument."},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Seems to be an emotionally charged review"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"The flow and points don't make sense.

{"_id":"5e8e5d5b1c9d440000804b60","product":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008X9Z73U","review":"The Belikin Genuine Leather Standing Case for the Kindle Fire HD 7\" is a very nice looking cover. It fits perfect on all four corners. The cork material has a very nice soft feel to it, and all of the other parts of the cover feels very well crafted. The one thing that I have noticed that I will mention is that it has a rubberized texture to it, which is annoying. It does the same for all the other components, however, and even the buttons just don't seem soft. For example, the volume buttons just stick out way too much even on a smooth surface.  The plastic around the case also seems plastic but it feels slightly stiff which doesn't matter. There is a plastic tab on the side of the cover which seems to be connected to the cover with a Velcro cord. You can close the tab to disconnect the cord and remove the cover for clean and neat things like your Kindle to a case with a lid. The quality of the material, however, is nothing like that of the regular leather cover.  Other than that, the case is perfectly functional. The cover itself is an attractive, attractive design. The quality of the plastic is top notch with excellent construction and excellent detailing. The design is just a flat-out beautiful piece of fabric, with an interesting looking design.   The one thing that I was disappointed about with the case is that the cover falls off a little, but I don't really regret it. Other than that, the case is well constructed and the fabric is comfortable. The only minor complaint I have with it was that it has a big \"B\" on the side.  If you are a little skinny, it may be a little awkward to remove the cover that is just bent or bent to whatever shape it was built into the case, but I think you can just flip it by pulling on the \"Z\" end of the velcro cord.  ***Update***  I read and reviewed this product in person earlier this week.   The Belikin Genuine Leather  Standing Case for the Kindle Fire HD 7\" fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly. The cover is great and tight fits the Kindle perfectly. The packaging does seem a little confusing at first, but after that I get with it easily and the cover really does fit my Kindle, as well as the other Kindles.   Update 2-25-18 As stated in the previous review, the casing material has a slight \"sheariness\" as it is quite soft. If you feel it in the corners, the corners are well placed.  Update 2-10-2018  I finally ordered this for my little Kindle Fire HD 7\", which has already read it a few times.  UPDATE 12-4-17 I have read this product a few many times.  I really enjoy the quality and the design of this case though. The color is very dark, as well as the design. I only wish it had a little bit less shear on it with those two exceptions which are minor and only one piece, in addition to the \"B\" on the side. However, it fits perfect as described in the previous review.  ***Update 9-30-17  The first Kindle Fire HD 7\" I ordered is getting its new protector and the case is getting replaced too, so all the original Kindle Fire's, including a couple of older Kindle Fire HD 1k models have been replaced. The case for this Kindle Fire HD is also being replaced, along with the rest of the Kindle Fire HD Series. The case is so sturdy that I am not even considering returning anything to Amazon, though if you don't want to return something the \"B\" on the cover is the most annoying item.  UPDATE 9-9-17  Also a few Kindle Fire HD Series owners have complained that the cover is too heavy and that they can only install it loosely.  UPDATE 9-4-17  It still has a little shear and I can't actually pull my Kindle from the cover completely.","type":"finetuned","feedback":[{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"Sounds like a common product review"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"reasonable complaints, but weird to write exact name of the product"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"references pros and cons"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"7","feedback":"didn't have emotion "},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"8","feedback":"focused on cover, flows well"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"Sounds like a human experience"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"5","feedback":"Both good things and bad things listed (assuming bots wouldn't be made to give neutral reviews)"},{"guess":false,"confidence_ranking":"9","feedback":"there is repetition that doesn't make sense"},{"guess":true,"confidence_ranking":"6","feedback":"The flow, phrasing and comments make sense and the grammar errors seems like normal human ones.

When he got it back a few minutes later it had turned back orange. It appears the warmth and friction of being handled triggers the change to white and the car goes back to orange when cold again.
